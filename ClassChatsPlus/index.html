In order to help one another share academic resources, there needs to be an environment where students can freely communicate and feel comfortable. Schools in the Boston area currently lack a strong social platform, and so ClassChats+ intends to fill the gap where students can come together and learn collectively.</p><h2>Guidelines:</h2><ul><li>Treat others online as you would treat them in real life.</li><li>Be tolerant towards otherâ€™s viewpoints; respectfully disagree when opinions do not align.</li><li>Respect the privacy and personal information of other students.</li><li>Communicate with courtesy and respect.</li></ul><h2>Please Do Not:</h2><ul><li>Make personal attacks on other community members.</li><li>Use defamatory remarks or make false statements against others.</li><li>Post prejudiced comments or profanity.</li><li>Bully or make inflammatory remarks to other community members.</li></ul><h2>Use Messaging Responsibly:</h2><div>These tools are intended to keep students in touch with one another, to help facilitate networking and to promote common interests. Some examples might include:<br><ul><li>Inviting local area students to a networking event or to join a local club.</li><li>Helping to coordinate a class reunion.</li><li>Reaching out to individual students for advice, to reconnect or to join a group.</li></ul></div><h2>Consequences:</h2><p>We will take action when we see someone violating these guidelines. Sometimes that just means giving someone a warning; other times it means revoking certain privileges or accounts entirely. We request that all community members report behavior that violates our guidelines to vtran.org.</p></div></div></div>
